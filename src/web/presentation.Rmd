## The USDA ReConnect Program
### - Three rounds of funding completed, with the fourth on-going
### - 316 projects approved and $3.86 billion invested since 2019

<br>
<br>

## Three primary goals of 2023 DSPG Summer Project: 

### 1. Improve dataset quality at household level through geocoding and web scraping
### 2. Assess the impact of a completed ReConnect project on internet connection
### 3. Create a workflow that can be scaled nationally and reproduced for future projects

# Our methodology consists of three major steps

<br>

## (1) Link internet data to property data using street address and geocoding
## (2) Create treatment and control group using matching algorithm based upon <br> property location and characteristics
## (3) Perform regressional analysis to examine effect of ReConnect project

# Summary of datasets 

|    Dataset  |      Level        |      Key Contents       | Year |
|------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------:|
| BlackKnight Property Data |  Household level  | Housing characteristics (e.g. number of bedrooms), address, coordinates |  2021 |
| ReConnect Subscription Data | Household level | Subscription speed, address, coordinates |  2021 | 
| Ookla Speed Test Data |    620m by 620m tiles     |    Average speed and number of tests within each tile, geometry of tiles     |    2019 - 2022 |

# Geocoding Schema

## Address and geocoded latitude-longitude information area key to link different datasets, but upon exploratory analysis, we found that

# Ookla Imputation

<br>

### Ookla provides data as the average speed testing result in a 600-by-600 meter tile.
### We applied a Gaussian kernel to impute speed at each propery based on their lat-long.

# Rural Buffer Zone

<img src="img/bufferzone.png" width="500" />

## To ensure the ReConnect subscrbers (treatment group) are compared to similar communities, we choose the control group only from the project buffer zone, which is
### - the surrounding area within 20 miles of the project
### - belongs to a census tract that is rural, defined by
### - a Rural Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) code at least 7
