## The USDA ReConnect Program
### - Three rounds of funding completed, with the fourth on-going
### - 316 projects approved and $3.86 billion invested since 2019

<br>
<br>

## Three primary goals of 2023 DSPG Summer Project: 

### 1. Improve dataset quality at household level through geocoding and web scraping
### 2. Assess the impact of a completed ReConnect project on internet connection
### 3. Create a workflow that can be scaled nationally and reproduced for future projects

<br>

# Our methodology consists of three major steps

<br>

## (1) Link internet data to property data using street address and geocoding
## (2) Create treatment and control group using matching algorithm based upon <br> property location and characteristics
## (3) Perform regressional analysis to examine effect of ReConnect project

# Geocoding Schema

## Address and geocoded latitude-longitude information area key to link different datasets, but upon exploratory analysis, we found that

# Ookla Imputation

<br>

### Ookla provides data as the average speed testing result in a 600-by-600 meter tile.
### We applied a Gaussian kernel to impute speed at each propery based on their lat-long.

# Rural Buffer Zone

## To ensure the ReConnect subscrbers (treatment group) are compared to similar communities, we choose the control group only from the project buffer zone, which is
### - the surrounding area within 20 miles of the project
### - belongs to a census tract that is rural, defined by
### - a Rural Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) code at least 7

# Matching treatment group and control group

<br>

### We implemented a matching algorithm based on between subscriber and buffer-zone properties on number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, building area, age of building, and 2021 assessed value. Each subscriber is matched to a property with the minimum Mahalanobis distance.

<br>
<br>

# Here presents the difference-in-difference analysis results

PredictedSpeed_{h,t} = \alpha + \beta treatment_h + \gamma year_t + \delta_{DD}treatment_h * year_t + e_{h,t}
$$

## The primary Conclusion of our analysis is that we have strong evidence to believe the implementation of the ReConnect project brings a statistically significant improvment to internet connectivity in the example project area.

# Future Steps
<br>
<br>

## - Evaluate additional sources to supplement Ookla imputation, such as M-Lab.
## - Explore solutions to systematic missing of property info in certain states.
## - Reproduce the analysis as newly completed projects data becomes available.
